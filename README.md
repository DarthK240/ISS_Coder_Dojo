# ISS_Tracker
Hi all! Sid here.
This program, when run, gives the user his or her current location based upon the IP of that user's computer and tells the user when the ISS (International Space Station) will pass over their city next. I have also implemented another part to the project that tweets when the ISS is going to pass over the user's city. One would need a dev account on Twitter for the API key and the other keys.

Prerequisites:
1. JSON library
2. Requests library
3. Time Library
4. Twython Library
5. Twitter Dev Account sign-up: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs
 
 
 
 
 (Please note that all code is written in Python.)
