# ISS_Coder_Dojo
Hi all! Sid here.
You might remember me by my ISS project that I shared at the most recent CoderDojo. This program, when run, gives the user his or her current location based upon the IP of that user's computer and tells the user when the ISS (International Space Station) will pass over their city next. I have also implemented another part to the project that tweets when the ISS is going to pass over the user's city. (Please note that all code is written in Python.)
